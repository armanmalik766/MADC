										>Nagpur, the second capital of Maharashtra State has a
										strategic place among the international aviation routes. Its
										unique location at the crossing of the air route between
										Europe and South-East Asia, as well as between South Africa
										and North-East Asia makes it a logical and ideal location
										for passenger and cargo hub. The project involves
										construction of a second runway, a new terminal building and
										a cargo complex through a build-operate-transfer basis. This
										will may Nagpur city one among the most important business
										and economic nucleus in the central India and Asia.

										>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport is a customs
										airport serving the city of Nagpur, Maharashtra and India.
										It was named after Bharat Ratna Dr. "Babasaheb" Ambedkar,
										the chief architect of the Indian Constitution in 2005.
										Though an airport has been existing at Nagpur for many
										years, it has never been an important airport, possibly
										because airport developments so far in India were based on
										regional requirements and there was no concept of hub
										airport. At present about 120 – 140 passenger trains and
										about 80 – 100 freight trains cross Nagpur every day. Apart
										from this over 7000 trucks cross Nagpur every day. Their
										integration with International Passenger and Cargo Airport
										facilities would make it very advantageous and cost
										effective for development of air transportation.

									<li class="py-1">
										<span class="fas fa-check-circle text-success me-2"></span
										>The prospects for cargo traffic are enhanced by the
										development of an Inland Container Terminal (ICT) and Truck
										Terminal (TT) close to the airport. The ICT has domestic and
										international divisions and has services by rail and road
										links. In view of the excellent position of Nagpur on the
										trunk national routes of roadways and railway, considerable
										amount of inter-modal cargo traffic, from and to road and
										rail modes is expected for the airport.

									<li class="py-1">
										<span class="fas fa-check-circle text-success me-2"></span>
										The proposed hub Airport will help Nagpur to emerge as a
										leading international tourist gateway for India providing a
										number of new tourism route options, especially for
										Adventure, Wild life and Buddhist tour circuits.
									</li>
									<li class="py-1">
										<span class="fas fa-check-circle text-success me-2"></span
										>The potential for creating an international hub airport at
										Nagpur can be gauged from the fact that there is hardly any
										Hub Airport in a 5-hour fly-zone from India (i.e. between
										Dubai and Singapore). All over the world there are clusters
										of hub airports within 1 to 2 hours of fly zone. Much
										smaller countries around India over the years have
										successfully set up major hubs and are drawing huge transit
										traffic.

										>Nagpur has very good potential for becoming an International Hub Airport also in view of its geographic location. For the international hub-and-spoke traffic, the following routes have been identified as potential Hub-routes: Europe- S-E Asia & South Pacific; Africa-NE Asia; Europe-South West Asia; NE / SE Asia-South West Asia. On the domestic front Nagpur will act as a hub for all North-South-East-West traffic in India. Nagpur probably has the best location in India from the point of view of sustaining domestic hubbing.

										>Nagpur Airport is expected to draw its due share from the available market for India. Depending upon the kind of infrastructure at Nagpur and the competition from existing and proposed new hub airports. Nagpur has a distinct advantage over other proposed Airports in terms of (a) low gestation period (on account of the existing Airport); (b) expected rapid development of domestic connectivity (on account of its unique location to support domestic hubbing); (c) Easy Access to almost 10% of the potential International hubbing traffic in the form of currently over-flying flights over the City (accounted by over 55 different Airlines); (d) Possibility of creating perhaps the best multi-modal infrastructure in the country within MIHAN
